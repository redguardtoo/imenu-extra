* Add extra items into existing imenu items
Extra imenu items can be easily *added* into existing imenu items generated by major/minor modes ([[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/][lsp-mode]], [[https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode][js2-mode]], etc).

* Install and Setup
You could place =imenu-extra.el= under [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath][Load Path]], then add =(require 'imenu-extra)= to your configuration.

But I recommend to use [[http://melpa.org/]] to install the package.

Setup is simple,

At the *end of minor/major mode hook*, call =imenu-extra-auto-setup= which has one parameter "patterns".

Patterns should be an =alist= of the same form as =imenu-generic-expression=.

For example, insert below code *at the end* of =js2-mode-hook= to extract unit test case as imenu items from javascript code,
#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'js2-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            ;; original js2-mode setup ...

            ;; at the end of mode hook
            (imenu-extra-auto-setup '(("tdd.it" "^[ \t]*it('\\([^']+\\)" 1)
                                      ("tdd.desc" "^[ \t]*describe('\\([^']+\\)" 1))))
#+end_src
* Usage
Use imenu as usual.
